  Seeker is a Serverless framework built on top elixir.

  A function written in the DSL defined in `Composer.DSL` can be used to create a component.

  Component is the most basic element of the framework.

  Once components are defined, they can be linked to each other by creating Workflows.

  Each workflow is exposed via an API, which can then be accessed across the web.
